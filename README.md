# Predicting house pricing
This project searches for the best model to predict prices of houses based on features in the dataset "AmesHousing" which was the base for a [paper](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock.pdf) by Dean De Cock of Truman State University. Description of the dataset can be found [here](http://jse.amstat.org/v19n3/decock/DataDocumentation.txt).

The following steps were taken:
- simple linear regression model 
- selection of best features for linear model
- applying selected features into random forrest estimator
